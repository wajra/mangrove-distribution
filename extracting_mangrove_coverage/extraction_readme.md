# Extracting the mangrove coverage of Sri Lanka from global database

The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) hosts distribution data for several habitats. Among these is a shapefile containing global distribution data for mangrove forests.

In this example we will filter out this global shapefile and retain only features in Sri Lanka

## Notice
We will be using 'Fiona' for data extraction and manipulation. Install fiona using 'conda install fiona' command or 'pip install fiona'
